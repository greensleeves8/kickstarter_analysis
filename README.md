# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise approached us to assist her with her crowdfunding campaign for her play, *Fever*. She had an
initial idea of the budget she would need to put on the play, but asked us to examine Kickstarter
data to see if we could get an idea of what factors go into creating a successful funding campaign. 

### Purpose

To analyze a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns as a means to help Louise determine the proper course of 
action for her own campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Our analysis was mainly focused on the comparison of outcomes by their launch date grouped by month, 
and the success of campaigns based on their monetary goal. In addition to these main questions, we 
also addressed several other questions Louise had. We filtered Kickstarter campaigns by category and 
subcategory to find the information that would be most relevant to Louise's questions. In addition, we 
separated campaigns by country and whether they failed or succeeeded at reaching their goal. We
analyzed the measures of central tendency and spread to quantify the differences between successful 
and failed campaigns. Finally, we pulled data for Louise regarding two questions she had about 
potential future projects, the first about successful campaigns for plays that entered the Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, and the second regarding the difference between successful and failed campaigns for 
musicals in Great Britain.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One of the challenges that we encountered in our analysis was in finding campaigns that were
appropriate examples of the information that Louise was looking for. The initial dataset we 
were given included campaigns across a broad array of categories and subcategories, and data from
many different countries. By sorting and filtering our data to focus on US theater and play 
campaigns, we were able to narrow down the data given to us to focus on information applicable
to Louise's needs. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the data we analyzed comparing the outcome of various theater Kickstarter campaigns by their
launch date, May is the best month to launch a Kickstarter campaign for a theater project, with June 
and July also good months to launch a campaign. Conversely, December seems to be the worst time to 
start a crowd funding project, with both the lowest number of total successful campaigns and the 
highest percentage of campaigns failing to reach their goal.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the data we analyzed comparing the success of Kickstarter campaigns to their financial goals, 
the campaigns most likely to succeed were projects with a financial goal under $5000, though campaigns 
in the range of $35,000 to $45,000 also had a high rate of success, albeit in a extremely small sample 
size. Financial goals over $45,000 were very unlikely to meet their financial goals. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Kickstarter as a website and the general concept of internet crowdfunding are relatively new. Ideally, 
one would like a larger sample of data across time to make a comparison. Though theater and plays were
some of the larger categories/subcategories within the dataset, more information is always helpful in 
drawing conclusions, and there are many variables that influence whether a campaign is successful or 
not. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other questions that I would find interesting: a comparison between successful and failed campaigns,
and whether they tend to have a higher count of backers, or higher average donations; a closer
examination of campaigns that exceeded their goals by the highest percentage of their initial goal; 
and whether how long a campaign runs for is a factor in the success of the campaign.
